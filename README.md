# Frontend Module

The DWUK Banking App is divided into 2 repositories:

- the current documentation is for the _Frontend Module_ and
- [this is the backed or the API](https://github.com/Cat4848/api-dwuk-banking-app)

## Live Deployment

I deployed the app on _Vercel_ and it's fully connected to the backend for a seamless experience.

Please have a look at the [live link here](https://client-dwuk-banking-app.vercel.app/).

## Technologies Used

- **NextJS:** modern React framework that helps me with frontend routing
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript, selected for its ability to augment project safety. By introducing static typing, TypeScript furnishes me with a shield against runtime errors. Although it may demand additional development time, I view this investment as integral to ensuring the reliability and stability of my software.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, please run the following command in a terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/Cat4848/client-dwuk-banking-app`

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
