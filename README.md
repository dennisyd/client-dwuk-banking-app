# Frontend

- **NextJS:** modern React framework that helps me with frontend routing
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript, selected for its ability to augment project safety. By introducing static typing, TypeScript furnishes me with a shield against runtime errors. Although it may demand additional development time, I view this investment as integral to ensuring the reliability and stability of my software
- **Testing:** I chose `Jest` for testing because I already have experience writing tests using this technology

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
